# Changelog

## [1.8.0] - 2024-10-13

### Fixed

 - Fixes in polyhedra domain.
 - Fixes and precision improvements in depth-k domain.

### Added

 - `basicdom` tutorial.

### Improved

 - Better documentation in domains.pl, debugging CiaoPP, and usage.
 - Better documentation for debugging CiaoPP.
 - Types/modes in CiaoPP tutorial.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-7-13

### Added

 - Mercury-like determinism properties. Those are mapped to other
   existing determinism and non-failure properties as follows: `multi`
   is `not_fails`, `semidet` is `is_det`, `det` is `not_fails` and
   `is_det`.
 - New flag `param_type_args` (control whether parametric type
   arguments use escaped values or require new type symbols).
 - Improved tutorials (using active logic documents) and examples.
 - Module unexpansion in warning/error messages predicate and program
   point assertions.

### Fixed

 - Avoid NaN in assertion checking summaries.
 - Fixes in compile time checks (ctchecks) for false/check cost assertions.
 - Automatic domain selection: avoid unavailable domains (and warn
   user), skip properties with no known domain.
 - Fixes in printing program point info.
 - Fixed type visibility in output and type simplification (see `typeslib_is_visible/2`).
 - Fixed bug in denormalization of parametric properties (introduced
   when higher order application switched to natural argument)
 - Minor fixes in `det` and `nf`, missing cuts, improved documentation.
 - More accurate predicate import database (in `p_unit`).
 - Fix in parametric type counter when using lib cache.
 - Mark `shfret` as a domain that supports types.
 - Fix `gather_measure/7` so that it uses `assertion_read/9`.
 - Add `nativeprops` when when analyzing with sharing domains,
   complete `determinable/2` to support missing sharing domains.

### Improved

 - Suppress superfluous ctcheck messages about calls (verified empty
   calls and calls that come from entries)
 - Eliminated extra newlines in assertion checking messages.
 - Note message when library cache is not generated.
 - Use (analysis information of) general properties "prop" (only local
   props whose clauses are available) for assertion checking.
 - Minor fix in builtin recsolvers' simplification of sums.

### Changed

 - `fd` domain renamed to `frdef`
 - The `p_unit` has been simplified, optimized, and promoted as a Ciao
   library. Other components has been isolated and kept in the CiaoPP
   source tree: `p_dump` (output), multiple language frontends.
 - Removed flags `tmp_dir` and `asr_dir` (not used, integrated into
   `CIAOCCACHE`).
 - Enable by default assertion simplification.

## [1.6.0] - 2022-9-28 

### Added

 - Integrate test case generation for assertion-based random test
   generation (currently `ciaotest` bundle) fully into CiaoPP's
   assertion checking pipeline.

### Improved

 - Improvements in tutorials. Tutorials are grouped in a separate
   CiaoPP manual, containing:
   - Interactive tutorials from `exfilter`
   - Other tutorials (quick start and larger) from reference manual
 - Added `--ciaopp:lite=[yes|no]` bundle config flag (which disables
   the inclusion of additional bundles)
 - `output/\{1,2\}` instantiates unbound `File` arg with default if
   needed.
 - Showing summaries of assertion checking (count check, checked,
   false, etc. assertions).
 - Unify ctcheck assertion checking at predicate level and literal
   level.
 - Improved documentation of normal form expressions (`normal_form`)
   (`ciaopp_cost`).

### Fixed

 - Make sure that typedefs are written to `current_output`.
 - Call sockets initialization only if/when required.
 - Fixed bug in `polyhedra:project_on_dimensions/5`, adding missing copies.
 - Fix variable names in raw output (name counter was reset in the
   wrong places).
 - Recover documentation figure for `infercost`/`resources`.
 - Fix in `res_plai` handling of size types. An error in the
   length/semantics of lists in
   `res_plai_aux:update_non_rec_param_args` made `res_plai` fail when
   working with regtypes whose definition involves rules with some
   recursive calls being placed before a non-recursive call.

 - CHANGED: Assertion simplification (eliminating statically proven
   properties from run-time checks) now enabled by default during
   assertion checking.

   `trust success` and `trust comp` assertions.
 - CHANGED: Abort `auto_interface` action early if there is a
   compilation error.
 - CHANGED: `pp_info` flag (printing analysis infor at literal
   level) moved to the naive menu.

   dangling choicepoints; avoid printing some calls assertions twice;
   wrong use of `denorm_goal_prop/3` changed to
   `prop_unapply/3`; missing clause to `abs_exec_cond:type_of/4`
   to handle `deftypes` domain.

  options for: showing the contents of a dump file, a code
  reachability report, static, offline checks of assertions using
  a dump file, and general statistics for the analysis results.
 - ADDED: Added @tt{-op Suffix} option to ciaopp command-line (useful for flycheck).
 - ADDED: Warning if no entries were found
 - ADDED: Unified messages, now controlled by `ciaopp_log.pl`

not-yet-simplified parts of assertions in the `check` case. Perhaps
should go a separate module at some point.  (Pawel Pietrzak)

## [1.0.910] - 2004-11-25

../ctchecks/ctchecks_pred.pl

Changes to the scheme of checking `success P:Pre => Post` in the

subterms and not only atoms.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.906] - 2004-11-20

../spec/spec.pl

The predicate decide_perform_unif is no longer needed as this is
   directly handled now by spec_iterate.pl.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.905] - 2004-11-20

../spec/spec_iterate.pl

Improved handling of unifications introduced by execution of facts and
bridges. They are now directly executed here rather than in
spec.pl. Also, dictionaries are updated when unifications are
executed.  (German Puebla)


## [1.0.903] - 2004-11-19

../infercost/algebraic/compare.pl

Added and exported `exp_eq_than(Ex1, Ex2)`.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.902] - 2004-11-19

../infercost/algebraic/algebraic.pl

## [1.0.901] - 2004-11-19

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Predicate `abs_execute_with_info/4` now works for exact size
property (`size/2`). (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.900] - 2004-11-18

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added predicate `eliminate_bottoms_and_equivalents/3`.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.899] - 2004-11-18

../spec/unfold.pl

Added comment(bug,3).  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.898] - 2004-11-18

../spec/unfold.pl

The unfolding rule `df_tree_hom_emb` cannot choose now any value
for the flag `comp_rule` different from `leftmost`. This is
currently hardwired in the code. Although, in the long term, the menu
should disable those values which are not applicable. In the case of
`hom_emb_anc`, the computation rule was fixed to leftmost since the
beginning.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.897] - 2004-11-18

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added value `jump_builtin` for flag `comp_rule`. (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.896] - 2004-11-18

../spec/unfold.pl

Unfolding rules have been adapted to deal with a list of suspended
atoms which is needed for the new computation rule
`jump_builtin`. Only `df_tree_hom_emb` and `hom_emb_anc` do
not work with `jump_builtin` due to the fact that atoms are tuples
in order to track ancestor information. (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.895] - 2004-11-18

../spec/unfold_local.pl

New computation rule `jump_builtin` which selects always the
leftmost goal but can jump over builtins when they are not
evaluable. A main difference with existing computation rules is that
unfolding is performed 'in situ', i.e., without reordering the atoms
in the goal.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.894] - 2004-11-17

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Added clause to `abs_execute_with_info/4` for handling det domain
   properly.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.893] - 2004-11-17

../ctchecks/comp_ctchecks.pl

Deleted predicate de_native_prop/2 (not needed).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.892] - 2004-11-17

../p_unit/native.pl

Added size_lb/2, size_ub/2, size_o/2, and size/2 as native properties.
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.891] - 2004-11-17

../infer/gather_modes.pl

Fixed bug in the inference of modes which caused that predicates not
appearing in the body of any clause were not analyzed by cost/size
analyses.  Added vartypes_to_modes/2 and modified
eliminate_dead_code/10. (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.890] - 2004-11-17

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Finished definition of predicate check_size_info/3 for checking
assertions involving size properties (it works for size_lb, size_ub
and size_o properties). Modified size_info/2.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.889] - 2004-11-17

../ctchecks/comp_ctchecks.pl

Finished definition of predicate abs_execute_sizes/5 for checking
assertions involving size properties (it works for size_lb, size_ub
and size_o properties).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.888] - 2004-11-16

../spec/abs_exec.pl

The handling of the dynamic abstract executability table is now
separately handled by exported `dyn_abs_exec/4`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.887] - 2004-11-16

../spec/spec.pl

The specializer no longer has predicate names hardwired in a builtin
table. Calls to predicates can be abstractly executed if (1) there is
an equiv assertion whose precondition holds, or (2) the predicate is
recognized as native and the static abstract executability table can
handle it, or (3) it is an imported predicate which has been multiply
specialized and thus is in the dynamic abstract executability table.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.886] - 2004-11-16

../spec/spec_iterate.pl

Data predicate `clause_result/2` now lives in module
spec_iterate.pl.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.885] - 2004-11-16

../infer/infer.pl

Modified adapt_info/3 for dealing with determinacy info (det domain).
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.884] - 2004-11-16

../plai/domains.pl

Adapted obtain_info/5 for getting determinacy info (det domain).
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.883] - 2004-11-16

../plai/domains/detabs.pl

Added det_obtain/4 for getting determinacy info.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.882] - 2004-11-16

../plai/domains/detplai.pl

Added det_obtain/4 for getting determinacy info.  Modified split/4 for
dealing with bottom.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.881] - 2004-11-16

../ctchecks/comp_ctchecks.pl

Adapted get_det_info/3 for getting determinacy info (det domain).
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.880] - 2004-11-16

../menu_generator.pl

Fixed potential bug when saving menu flags.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.879] - 2004-11-15

../spec/mem_usage.pl

Improved documentation.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.878] - 2004-11-15

../ctchecks/assrt_ctchecks_pp.pl

Minor fixes to pp checking and to printing messages. Added a call to
`adapt_info_to_assrt_head/6`. (Pawel Pietrzak)

## [1.0.877] - 2004-11-15

../plai/intermod.pl

Added exported predicates `monolithic_analyze/3` and
`auto_analyze/3` which return information about the time spent in
several phases of modular analysis.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.876] - 2004-11-15

../plai/intermod.pl

Added naive_top_down and naive_bottom_up global scheduling policies.
(Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.875] - 2004-11-15

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added naive_top_down, naive_bottom_up values to global_scheduling
preprocess flag.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.874] - 2004-11-14

../spec/spec.pl

Reimplemented handling of calls to regular types. The previous version
based on `abs_exec_reg_type_with_post_info/4` was very beatiful
and efficient but may produce wrong results if type analysis is not as
precise as it could be. This happens when analyzing imported types.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.873] - 2004-11-14

../spec/abs_exec_ops.pl

Added exported `abs_exec_regtype_in_clause/7`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.872] - 2004-11-14

(German Puebla)

## [1.0.871] - 2004-11-14

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

Exported predicate `abs_exec_regtype/3` is now in abs_exec_ops.pl
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.870] - 2004-11-13

../spec/spec.pl

Exported predicate `get_predicate_names/4` now lives in module
spec_multiple.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.869] - 2004-11-13

../spec/spec_multiple.pl

Exported predicate `get_predicate_names/4` now lives in module
spec_multiple.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.868] - 2004-11-13

../auto_interface/auto_interface.pl

Added question for flag exec_unif in expert specialization menu.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.867] - 2004-11-13

../spec/spec.pl

Execution of `arithmetic:is/2` at specialization time is now
controlled by pp_flag `exec_unif` instead of data predicate
perform_unif.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.866] - 2004-11-13

../spec/spec_iterate.pl

Removed exported (data) predicate perform_unif, since this is now
controlled by pp_flag `exec_unif`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.865] - 2004-11-13

../spec/abs_exec.pl

Reorganized and clarified code for abstract executability and the use
of native props.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.864] - 2004-11-13

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

Unified abs exec of regular types in new exported predicate
`abs_exec_regtype/3`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.863] - 2004-11-12

../p_unit/p_canonical.pl

Commented predicate `decide_pred_status/2` which belongs to old
specification implementation.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.862] - 2004-11-12

../p_unit/p_canonical.pl

Status of calls assertions derived from `trust pred` is now
`check`.  (Pawel Pietrzak)

## [1.0.861] - 2004-11-11

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Now `update_current_registry/3` marks callers registries if an
invalidated entry of the current module registry has been reanalyzed.
(Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.860] - 2004-11-11

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Added an initial version of get_all_modules_depth/2 (to obtain the
list of modules in a program unit with their depths --all modules in a
cycle have the same depth).  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.859] - 2004-11-11

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Added an extra argument to `imported_modules/2` to store the
basename of every module.  (Jesus Correas)

Added question for error_log flag in expert checking menu.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.825] - 2004-11-06

have to check the success substitution for the literal instead of the
call substitution, as was being done.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.824] - 2004-11-06

../ctchecks/ctchecks.pl

The fact that a literal never succeeds cannot be interpreted as an
error. We now issue warning_message instead of error_message.  (German
Puebla)

   actually the previous file.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.814] - 2004-11-05

../ctchecks/ctchecks_pred.pl

Modifications to exploit multivariant analysis in checking call and
success assertions at predicate level. The way of the checking is
controlled by collapse_ai_vers and multi_success flags. (Pawel
Pietrzak)

## [1.0.813] - 2004-11-05

../infer/infer.pl

Added predicate `get_completes/4` to get a set of completes
rather then their lub. Needed for multivariant assertion checking.

## [1.0.807] - 2004-11-04

../plai/domains/typeslib/regtype_basic_lattice.pl

Added comments and documentation.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.806] - 2004-11-04

../plai/domains/typeslib/regtype_basic_lattice.pl

Modified dz_type_selects/2: now it uses the predicate
dz_subset_lattice/2, which defines basic inclusion relations in the
type lattice. This allows reducing code a lot: removing the code
duplicating the functionality provided by dz_subset_lattice/2.  Also,
it makes type operations more flexible wrt changes in the type lattice
allowing performing modifications easily. Note however that
dz_subset_lattice/2 does not define inclusion relations involving
compound type terms nor rule type symbols. These relations are defined
by other predicates. The reason for this separate treatment is that it
avoids recursive calls in dz_subset_lattice/2, making type operations
more flexible wrt changes in the type lattice and easing
modifications. However, the separate treatment of compound type terms
and rule type symbols does not involve a lost in generality of type
operations, since it is assumed that compound type terms and rule type
symbols are present in all regular type lattices.  For example, in
order to redefine the type inclusion operation for a new regular type
lattice, it suffices to redefine dz_subset_lattice/2 and additionally
basic_lattice_type_includes_compound_type_term/1 (which defines the
types in the new lattice that include compound type terms). Similarly,
in order to redefine the type intersection operation for a new regular
type lattice, it suffices to redefine
regtype_basic_type_intersection/2 (which defines basic intersection
operations between types in the lattice, except those involving
compound type terms and rule type symbols), and
basic_lattice_type_needs_intersection_with_compound_type_term_args/2.
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.805] - 2004-11-03

../spec/unfold.pl

Use the package nomem_usage to avoid the overhead of measuring memory
consumption if we are not running experiments (German Puebla)

## [1.0.796] - 2004-10-30

../plai/plai.pl

argument of `plai/6` together with analysis time.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.795] - 2004-10-30

../spec/unfold.pl

Adapted to the new code in mem_usage. This allows computing the memory

analysis but also for the local_control (unfolding).  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.790] - 2004-10-30

../spec/unfold_times.pl

Added module `unfold_times`. This module contains a series of
dicates for measuring the time actually taken by local control
(unfolding).  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.789] - 2004-10-27

../spec/unfold.pl

Added unfolding rule `df_tree_hom_emb` which implements ancestors
using a proof tree.  (German Puebla)

Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.777] - 2004-10-21

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

`irrelevant_file/1` was not saved in the ast files, so
check_properties did different things when loading the ast file than
when generating it. (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.776] - 2004-10-21

../ctchecks/ctchecks_pred.pl

Adapted code to use the new `abs_execute/2` version.  (David

Added fullinstallsrcnc that does all except compilation.  Useful to
test installation.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.768] - 2004-10-20

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `hom_emb_anc` within local control in order to select an
unfolding rule based on embedding which does not use ancestor stacks
for keeping track of the ancestor information.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.767] - 2004-10-20

../spec/unfold.pl

Added a new strategy `hom_emb_anc` for local unfolding which
implements an unfolding rule based on embedding without using
efficient ancestor stacks but avoiding the restriction to perform only
local unfolding.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.766] - 2004-10-19

../plai/domains/eterms.pl

atom/1, atomic/1 and get_code/2 are deleted from the builtins table of
eterms domain (Claudio Vaucheret)

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Removed the following warning message from
check_and_remove_empty_types/2: 'The type ~q IS EMPTY. Its type rule
is retracted'.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.760] - 2004-10-19

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Introduced a new item in the type lattice: gndstr (ground struct),
which is the intersection between gnd and struct (and modified type
operations accordingly).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.759] - 2004-10-19

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Fixed bug in typeslib:type_intersection_2/3 (make it call the right
predicates): Predicates typeslib:type_intersection/3 and
regtype_basic_lattice:type_intersection/3 are not mutual recursive
anymore. Renamed regtype_basic_lattice:type_intersection/3 to
regtype_basic_type_intersection/3 (and rewritten its definition in
order to avoid calls to typeslib:type_intersection/3).  Rewritten
typeslib:type_intersection/3 so that calls to
regtype_basic_lattice:regtype_basic_type_intersection/3 are not
(mutually) recursive anymore.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.758] - 2004-10-19

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Regarding comment version 1*0+611,2004/09/08 by David Trallero:
type_intersection/3 needs to be exported, because it is called by
type_intersection_2/3. Otherwise, the wrong type_intersection/3 (the
one in regtype_basic_lattice) is called, and type_intersection_2/3
does not work. (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.757] - 2004-10-19

../plai/domains/typeslib/regtype_basic_lattice.pl

Removed rat and anyfd types from the lattice (and modified type

Non-failure analysis is not performed for predicates which are not
reachable from those exported by the module being analyzed. (Pedro
Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.741] - 2004-10-14

../infernf/validation.pl

Added a new argument to validate_data/3 so that it creates a list with
predicates which are not reachable from those exported by the module
being analyzed (which are also the predicates for which there is no
mode/type information, since it is assumed that mode and type analysis
has been performed before).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.740] - 2004-10-14

../infernf/in_out.pl

Added remove_preds_from_scc_call_graph/3 to remove from the SCC Call
Graph those predicates which are not reachable from those exported by
the module being analyzed, so that they are not analyzed.  (Pedro
Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.739] - 2004-10-14

../spec/abs_exec_cond.pl

replaced calls to `type_intersection/3` with

## [1.0.737] - 2004-10-13

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

Fixed bug which made handling of complete_parents fail. Has to be
double checked.  (German Puebla)

Modified inter_ana flag to execute nf and cost analysis.  (David
Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.735] - 2004-10-12

Solved a bug that did not convert compound pred assertions with true
as a precondition to success assertions.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.734] - 2004-10-11

../plai/domains/eterms.pl

Commented out the clause for `atom/1` in
`eterms_special_builtin/5` which seems to be wrong.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.732] - 2004-10-11

../p_unit/clidlist.pl

first_key/2 takes into account cuts without keys (just ignore them).
(Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.731] - 2004-10-11

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added a new flag (ana_size) to control the type of size analysis:
lower bounds (size_lb), upper bounds (size_ub), or both
(size_ualb). (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.730] - 2004-10-11

../infer/prepare_ai_output.pl

prepare_ai_output_/4 and prepare_infer_output/1 take size_ualb (both,
upper and lower bound size analysis) into account, so that information
is put together in a unique assertion per predicate.  (Pedro Lopez
Garcia)

## [1.0.729] - 2004-10-11

../infer/infer_dom.pl

asub_to_info/6 takes into account a new size analysis option:

Garcia)

## [1.0.728] - 2004-10-11

../driver.pl

Added a new size analysis option: size_ualb (both, upper and lower
bound size analysis). (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.727] - 2004-10-11

../menu_generator.pl

Menu options are plain saved, so we dont distinguish between menu
levels (basic, advance, expert...). Read comment in
`save_flag_list/1`.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.726] - 2004-10-11

../plai/success.pl

Added an argument to `get_success_info/8` and
`apply_success_policy/9` to indicate whether there is any pattern
applicable to compute the success pattern or not.  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.725] - 2004-10-11

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

Added check to control if there are applicable analysis results or
trust information for library imported predicates. If there is no such
information, a warning message is raised.  (Jesus Correas)

../plai/domains/typeslib/basic_type_operations.pl

use_module(typeslib(regtype_basic_lattice) , [pure_type_term/1] ) back
to live. Necessary for properties assertions checking.  (David
Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.723] - 2004-10-09

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

Adapted to the fact that the native prop for nonvar/1 is not_free/1.
(German Puebla)

../spec/abs_exec_ops.pl

Modified `adapt_info_to_assert_head` since the latest changes
introduced were incorrect. In particular, a new argument `Vars` is
required. (German Puebla)

## [1.0.718] - 2004-10-10

../Makefile.pl

Fixed bug: Should generate lpdoc SETTINGS, at least until we move
./doc to lpmake/lpdoc.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.717] - 2004-10-09

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

Most of the information for abstract executability of the most
comments tests, i.e., those in `term_typing.pl` now lives in
`equiv` assertions in the library and are commented out from this
file.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.716] - 2004-10-09

../Makefile.pl

Bug corrections when generating distribution: the distclean option now
depends of the path_setup_src.pl file.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.715] - 2004-10-08

../spec/abs_exec.pl

Some improvements to `determinable/2`.  (German Puebla)

unifications are executed at specialization time.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.713] - 2004-10-09

../Makefile.pl

Updated files to support lpdoc-2.0 and lpmake.  Now gmake is not
required.  (Edison Mera)

static abstract executability table.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.709] - 2004-10-08

../spec/sp_clauses.pl

Added new (exported) predicate `collect_orig_clauses`, necessary
   for implementing depth-first local unfolding.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.708] - 2004-10-08

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `df_hom_emb_as` to select the depth-first implementation
of local unfolding with ancestor stacks. The breadth-first
implementation is now `hom_emb_as`.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.707] - 2004-10-08

../spec/unfold_local.pl

Reorganized the code and integrated the local unfolding rule in the
module `unfolding` with the remaining unfolding strategies. Now,
only the local selection of atoms lives here.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.706] - 2004-10-08

../spec/unfold.pl

Added a new depth-first implementation of the local unfolding rule
with ancestors stacks in order to improve efficiency of partial
evaluation in CiaoPP. It can be selected by setting the Local Control
flag (i.e.,`local_control`) to the value `df_hom_emb_as`.
(Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.705] - 2004-10-08

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

Added `initial_guess/7` to control the initial success
substitution used for a predicate that is to be analyzed. Its
objective is twofold: on the one hand, it allows to start the
computation of the success substitution in what 'initial_guess' flag
is set to. On the other hand, it sets the success substitution for
dynamic/multifile predicates to topmost, and adds the corresponding
trust information, if any. (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.704] - 2004-10-08

../infercost/infercost.pl

Changed lbsize and ubsize analysis names to size_lb and size_ub

analysis related flags.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.700] - 2004-10-06

../plai/fixpo_plai.pl

Modified handling of meta-calls in order to cope with meta-predicates
which have `clause` as meta argument.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.699] - 2004-10-06

../plai/fixpo_dx_check_common.pl

Modified handling of meta-calls in order to cope with meta-predicates
which have `clause` as meta argument.  (German Puebla)

Added (a call to) translation from parametric to non-parametric types
   before abstract execution (Pawel Pietrzak)

## [1.0.697] - 2004-10-07

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Removed cut in one_type_clause/2 - it has to be
non-deterministic. Now, user-defined types can have more than 1 rule.
(Pawel Pietrzak)

## [1.0.696] - 2004-10-07

../plai/success.pl

`apply_success_policy/8` adapted to apply the success policy to a
list of (call,success) patterns instead of being specific to the
intermodular scenario only.  This predicate is now exported.  (Jesus
Correas)

## [1.0.695] - 2004-10-07

../plai/entry_policy.pl

Fixed bug which prevented the addition of entry points related to
multifile predicates when a modular program is being analyzed.  (Jesus
Correas)

## [1.0.694] - 2004-10-07

../p_unit/itf_db.pl

Added module to multifile predicates information.  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.693] - 2004-10-07

../preprocess_flags.pl

Changed success_policy flag value 'bot' to 'bottom' (to make it equal
to initial_guess values).  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.692] - 2004-10-07

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added initial_guess flag to indicate how to obtain the initial guess
when performing the analysis of a predicate of the current module.
(Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.691] - 2004-10-04

../spec/global_control.pl

The flag `comp_rule` is read by the global control and passed to
the local control (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.690] - 2004-10-04

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `comp_rule` for choosing the computation rule to select
the atoms to be unfolded in the local control of partial evaluation.
(Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.689] - 2004-10-04

../spec/unfold.pl

Existing unfolding strategies have been parameterized with the
computation rule `comp_rule` in order to allow local unfolding.
(Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.688] - 2004-10-04

../spec/unfold_local.pl

Any unfolding strategy can now be performed with 3 different
computation rules: By default, we have `leftmost` unfolding. Then,
`local_builtin` implements a computation rule which first selects
builtins which can be evaluated. Finally, `local_emb` tries to
select atoms which do not endanger the embedding ordering or evaluable
builtins whenever possible.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.687] - 2004-10-02

../spec/spec.pl

Unified handling of dynamic and static abstract executability table

programs with cycles in the module dependency graph.  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.684] - 2004-10-03

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Modified the computation of the reachability relation between the
exported predicates of the current module and the predicates imported
from other modules, in order to deal with meta-calls.  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.683] - 2004-10-03

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Added the exported predicate get_all_module_cycles/2 that computes the
post-order traversal of the module graph, grouping the modules
involved in cycles.  Needed by the specializer of modular programs.

and STEPS_UALB (instead of lower, upper and both). (Pedro Lopez
Garcia)

## [1.0.677] - 2004-09-29

../spec/spec.pl

We now detect optimizations from specialized versions of predicates in
imported modules after abstract specialization has taken place for
them already.  (German Puebla)

../auto_interface/auto_interface.pl

Added question in spec menu for flag pres_inf_fail.  (David Trallero
Mena)

## [1.0.675] - 2004-09-28

../spec/unfold_local.pl

Unfolding is no longer restricted to leftmost selection and can be
used now with _local_ selection rules.  (Elvira Albert)

## [1.0.674] - 2004-09-28

../spec/spec_iterate.pl

Literals to the left of a literal which does not succeed are no longer
removed if the flag `pres_inf_fail` is `on`, even if they have
no side-effects.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.673] - 2004-09-28

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `pres_inf_fail` which controls whether finite failure
should be preserved during specialization or not.  (German Puebla)

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

include_parents/0 now propagates information to the ancestor modules
which are not in module_to_analyze_parents/1, instead of including
just immediate parents.  (Jesus Correas)

## [1.0.671] - 2004-09-27

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

get_intermodule_graph/3 has been reimplemented and changed to
get_intermodule_graph/2. It did not return the complete list of
modules to be analyzed.  (Jesus Correas)

Minor change in option fullinstall.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.668] - 2004-09-23

../spec/abs_exec_ops.pl

changed adapt_info_to_assrt_head, the abstract substitutions nead to
be projected to the goal's variables before to call to call_to_entry
(Claudio Vaucheret)

internal!. Use `type_intersection_2/3` instead.  (David Trallero
Mena)

## [1.0.610] - 2004-08-30

Code related to removal of useless clauses now lives here (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.606] - 2004-08-21

../spec/arg_filtering.pl

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

Fixed bug 7. The same asr file was read several times.  (David
Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.599] - 2004-08-06

../infercost/infercost.pl

Modified output_complexity_trust_info/9 so that cost analysis info is
asserted in module infer_db with identifiers steps_ub (upper bounds)
and steps_lb (lower bounds) (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.598] - 2004-08-06

../driver.pl

Modified analyze_/4 so that currently cost analysis options are:
steps_ub (upper bounds), steps_lb (lower bounds) and steps_ualb (both,
upper and lower bounds).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.597] - 2004-08-03

../p_unit/p_canonical.pl

Not asked for get_key_predicates, as we have to normalize all pred
assertions.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.596] - 2004-07-30

../p_unit/unexpand.pl

Added code in `transform_body/2` necessary to treat (A;B) (that
appears in assertions body).  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.595] - 2004-07-30

../p_unit/p_canonical.pl

Recoded a bit, to allow better integration with c_itf and Ciao in the
   future.  (David Trallero Mena)

../printer.pl

Fixed bug 13.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.589] - 2004-07-30

../driver.pl

The pp output is saved into the loaded directory file, not in the
working directory of ciaopp buffer.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.588] - 2004-07-29

../Makefile.pl

Added the option reconfigure, reconfiguresrc and installsrc to let
ciaopp can be loaded from the source instead of the installed
libraries.  This will be usefull for ciaopp developers.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.587] - 2004-07-28

../Makefile.pl

Corrected some incorrect behavior in the createdoc option.  (Edison
Mera)

## [1.0.586] - 2004-07-28

../plai/intermod.pl

Got rid of m_unit for performing monolithic analysis. Now multimodule
loading is available from p_unit and p_asr.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.584] - 2004-07-26

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

Internal predicates `related_file/1` and `processed_file/1`
now store basenames instead of full module file names.  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

## [1.0.583] - 2004-07-26

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Added in preprocessing_unit/3 code for handling a list of current
modules.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.582] - 2004-07-26

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

calls to `absolute_file_name/2` changed to
   `absolute_file_name/7`.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.581] - 2004-07-26

../p_unit/aux_filenames.pl

calls to `absolute_file_name/2` changed to
`absolute_file_name/7`.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.580] - 2004-07-26

../driver.pl

Added exported predicate modules/1-2 to load a list of current modules
into CiaoPP.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.578] - 2004-07-22

../Makefile.pl

Changed option environment.  Now it generate all the configuration
files.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.577] - 2004-07-22

../dist/Makefile.pl

Added option environment that configures ciaopp correctly.  (Edison
Mera)

## [1.0.576] - 2004-07-22

../spec/abs_exec_ops.pl

Added exported predicate `adapt_info_to_assrt_head/5`.  (German
Puebla)

../paths.pl

Moved options to paths_common.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.573] - 2004-07-20

../Makefile.pl

Modified the installation process.  Now it copies the library and
binary files to directories given by LIBDIR and BINDIR.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.572] - 2004-07-20

../spec/modular_spec.pl

`equiv/2` now has a `meta_predicate` declaration which makes
it not necessary to module qualify by hand.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.571] - 2004-07-19

../spec/spec.pl

The specializer can now properly handle literals which are calls to
predicates imported from other modules for which an `equiv`
assertion exists. In the preconditions in the assertion are proved to
hold, the literal is replaced by its corresponding optimized
version. Both monovariant and polyvariant specialization now profit
from `equiv` declarations.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.570] - 2004-07-19

../spec/abs_exec_cond.pl

Now `cond/4` can handle `ground` tests with non-variable
arguments.  (German Puebla)

Added exported predicate `abs_exec_conj_props/3`.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.568] - 2004-07-19

by hand.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.567] - 2004-07-19

../spec/spec_multiple.pl

Optimized generation of multiply specialized program by introducing
`decide_replace_version/2`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.566] - 2004-07-19

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

`ground/1` is now also executable to _true_ under condition
`ground(1)`, in addition to being executable to _ground/1_ which
is handled directly by the specializer.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.565] - 2004-07-19

../spec/abs_exec_ops.pl

Created module `abs_exec_ops`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.564] - 2004-07-19

../spec/spec_gen_pred_vers.pl

All the stuff related to the generation of the multiply specialized
program after version minimization lives now in module
`spec_gen_pred_vers`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.563] - 2004-07-17

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Fixed tr_syntax bug with brutal force.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.562] - 2004-07-16

module.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.558] - 2004-07-16

../p_unit/p_canonical.pl

Several `pred` are transformed into `calls` assertion with
disjuntion of call pred assertion body as body.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.557] - 2004-07-16

../printer.pl

The output contains rtchecks package only if it is necessary.  (David
Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.556] - 2004-07-16

../printer.pl

Filename contains the name of analysis and transformations applied.
(David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.555] - 2004-07-16

../spec/spec.pl

Implemented mono variant specialization of partially instantiated
calls to regular types via the use of
`abs_exec_reg_type_with_post_info/4`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.554] - 2004-07-16

../spec/abs_exec_cond.pl

Added exported predicate `abs_exec_reg_type_with_post_info/4`.
(German Puebla)

Puebla)

## [1.0.549] - 2004-07-15

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added copy_completes/1 to the exported predicates list. It is needed
by intermod.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.548] - 2004-07-15

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Registry file name generation moved to aux_filenames.pl.  (Jesus
Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.547] - 2004-07-15

../p_unit/aux_filenames.pl

Source file creation.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.546] - 2004-07-15

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

Added support for writing asr files (in ciaopp format, with '.ast'
extension). asr files are stored where `asr_dir` flag indicates:
either the directory where the corresponding source file resides, or a
given directory for all source files. Assertion reading procedure does
not fail if asr files cannot be written on disk (in order to work with
library directories with user write permissions disabled.  (Jesus
Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.545] - 2004-07-15

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added `asr_dir` flag to set the directory where asr files are to
be stored. This flag can be either `source` to indicate that the
asr files are stored in the same directory where the source file is
located, or an atom with a valid directory specification.  (Jesus
Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.544] - 2004-07-14

../spec/s_simpspec.pl

Reimplemented `next_or_last_key` so that it behaves correctly in
the presence of cut literals without keys and without making any
assumption on the internal representation of keys.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.542] - 2004-07-14

../driver.pl

Now `all_versions/5` is imported from module `spec_multiple`
instead of `spec`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.541] - 2004-07-14

../spec/static_abs_exec_table.pl

The static abstract executability table now lives in module
   `static_abs_exec_table`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.540] - 2004-07-14

../spec/modular_spec.pl

This module contains the dynamic abstract executability table for
predicates defined in imported modules. This table contains both
specialized versions introduced by hand and automatically generated.
(German Puebla)

   
## [1.0.539] - 2004-07-14

../spec/spec_multiple.pl

The machinery for performing (minimal) multiple specialization now
lives in module `spec_multiple`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.538] - 2004-07-14

../spec/spec_iterate.pl

Iterative optimization of programs now lives in module
`spec_iterate`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.537] - 2004-07-14

../spec/abs_exec_cond.pl

The abstract execution of conditions under which a literal can be
abstractly executed now lives in module `abs_exec_cond`.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.531] - 2004-07-07

../plai/plai.pl

Fixpoint module fixpo_di_mod removed. Now intermodular analysis is
integrated into fixpo_di.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.530] - 2004-07-07

../plai/intermod.pl

Fixpoint module fixpo_di_mod removed. Now intermodular analysis is
integrated into fixpo_di.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.529] - 2004-07-07

../preprocess_flags.pl

'fixpoint' option 'di_mod' removed. Now intermodular analysis is
integrated into 'di' fixpoint.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.528] - 2004-07-07

../spec/spec.pl

Implemented fully fledged handling of useless clauses. This includes
removing both facts and rules not only when there is no complete which
unifies with the clause but also when the abstract call pattern is
incompatible with the head of the clause. If these optimizations can
only be done in specialized versions, several versions will be
generated. I.e., useless clauses are now first class citizens for the
abstract specializer, same as abstractly executable literals.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.527] - 2004-07-07

../plai/fixpo_plai.pl

In `body_succ/8`, the success substitution is bottom whenever the
call substitution is bottom. Rather than using `bottom/1` to
generate the success substition, it is more efficient to unify it with
the call substitution, which we know is bottom. (German Puebla)

## [1.0.526] - 2004-07-07

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

In `body_succ/8`, the success substitution is bottom whenever the
call substitution is bottom. Rather than using `bottom/1` to
generate the success substition, it is more efficient to unify it with
the call substitution, which we know is bottom.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.524] - 2004-07-05

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Added decide_status (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.523] - 2004-07-05

../spec/unfold.pl

Important changes in order to take the abstract substitution into
acccount during local control. Not finished yet though.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.522] - 2004-07-05

../spec/unfold.pl

Useless clauses can now be removed during local control according to
the value of flag `rem_use_cls`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.521] - 2004-07-05

../spec/global_control.pl

Important changes in order to make global control depend not only on
the concrete call pattern but also to take the abstract call pattern
into account.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.520] - 2004-07-05

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added the flag `abs_exec` which controls whether abstract
executability should be performed directly during local control rather
than as a post processing phase.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.519] - 2004-07-05

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added the value `id_abs` for flag `global_control`. It differs
from `id` in that not only the concrete part but also the abstract
part has to be equivalent in order to reuse a specialized definition.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.518] - 2004-07-05

../preprocess_flags.pl

The value `hom_emb_l` for `local_control` has been globally
renamed to `hom_em_as` which stands for homeomorphic embedding with
ancestor stacks.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.517] - 2004-07-05

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `rem_use_cls` which controls whether removal of useless
clauses, i.e., those incompatible with the abstract call pattern,
should be performed during local control.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.516] - 2004-07-02

../plai/domains/eterms.pl

eterms:eterms_rename_abs/4 modified to create a new name for every
type in the substitutions coming from an external repository
--registry file, dump file-- (this is what is done when an entry
assertion is analyzed).  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.514] - 2004-07-02

../plai/success.pl

Added typedef handling to upload type definitions stored in registry
files.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.513] - 2004-07-02

../plai/intermod.pl

intermod flag reintroduced.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.512] - 2004-07-02

../plai/intermod.pl

Intermodule graph code moved to p_unit/p_abs.pl.  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

## [1.0.511] - 2004-07-02

../plai/intermod.pl

top_level_module/1 changed to top_level_module/2 for providing
top-level module basename.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.510] - 2004-07-02

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

Bug fixed which prevented intermodular analysis from working properly
(complete_parent/2 must be asserted whenever complete/6 is asserted).
(Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.509] - 2004-07-02

../plai/entry_policy.pl

Added typedef handling to upload type definitions stored in registry
files.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.508] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

upload_typedefs/2 added to rebuild type information from registry
files.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.507] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Intermodule graph traversal now uses tarjan algorithm to compute
strongly connected components.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.506] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Added code for creating .reg files for every module involved in the
analysis of a program unit, even if the .reg file is empty (for
library modules, this is enabled only if process_libraries flag is set
to 'on'). This behaviour is needed to perform incremental intermodular
analysis.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.505] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Bug fixed in get_modules_to_analyze/3. When intermod:auto_analyze/2
was used for reanalysing a program unit previously analyzed with
changes in some modules, get_modules_to_analyze/3 returned _all_ the
modules in the program unit except the top-level, instead of returning
only those with invalid registry information.  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

## [1.0.504] - 2004-07-02

../paths.pl

added path to `api` (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.503] - 2004-07-02

## [1.0.502] - 2004-07-02

../spec/abs_exec.pl

Chanted bot_type by is_empty_bottom. This is because bot_type means
bot, not that type intersection is bot.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.501] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/unexpand.pl

Modifications when printing assertions. Now they are well printed
(without ' in names) (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.500] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Added metrapred in type_of_goal for correct unexpand when printing
output Corrected a bug in bug numbers

    (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.499] - 2004-07-02

../p_unit/clause_db.pl

modified locate_clause_locator to throw and error when needed. Also
some cuts added because empty solutions were given.

    (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.498] - 2004-07-02

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

is_empty_type exported (David Trallero Mena)

is used. (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.492] - 2004-07-01

../doc/Makefile.pl

Corrected a bug that appears when creating the SETTINGS file. (Edison
Mera)

## [1.0.491] - 2004-07-01

../Makefile.pl

Corrected some bugs when installing documentation in the info file.
(Edison Mera)

## [1.0.490] - 2004-06-30

../dist/Makefile.pl

distsettings.pl renamed to DISTSETTINGS.pl (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.486] - 2004-06-30

../Makefile.pl

Now the install compiles CiaoPP, and places the documentation in the
correct place.  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.485] - 2004-06-23

../Makefile.pl

The installation process now compiles CiaoPP.  Corrected a bug that
changed the default behavior when there was no `.ciaorc` file
(thanks to Manuel Hermenegildo).  (Edison Mera)

## [1.0.484] - 2004-06-22

../plai/tarjan.pl

Predicate `step2/2` is now exported. The Tarjan algorithm is also
used by intermodular analysis (by means of this predicate).  (Jesus
Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.483] - 2004-06-18

../plai/domains/eterms.pl

With set_pp_flag(type_eval,on) eterms_call_to_success_builtin
evaluates predicates with comp assertion eval. (Claudio Vaucheret)

 
## [1.0.480] - 2004-06-18

../driver.pl

Added rtchecks_pp_ass. (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.479] - 2004-06-17

../menu_generator.pl

modifications added for new pp_flag multifile definitions. Also bug
corrected in space.  (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.476] - 2004-06-14

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Now `inexistent/2` does not fail when called with a goal which is
in a clause whose lines are not known. Added comment(bug) reminding
this should be solved.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.475] - 2004-06-01

../plai/intermod.pl

dump_flag_list added (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.474] - 2004-05-23

../plai/transform.pl

Cut not deleted from source anymore.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.451] - 2004-04-28

../spec/unfold.pl

Fail clauses are now added for predicates which are shown to fail
during partial evaluation. This has several pros (side_effect analysis
sees those predicates, run_time execution will not reach undefined
predicates) and the cons that the final program can be a bit
larger. The abstract specializer should be able to remove those fail
clauses in the end.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.450] - 2004-04-28

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

The new names in `compute_each_change` still gave
problems. Hopefully finally fixed now.  (German Puebla)

ana_g1 (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.444] - 2004-04-26

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

now compare_with_previous_analysis has a third argument. When it is
'=' (or a free variable) it compares for identical abstract

notify warning or error when assertion cannot be reduced (David
Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.441] - 2004-04-26

../plai/domains/eterms.pl

Added eterms_mult_part_conc which extends part_conc and gives
instantiations of goals even in the case types are not deterministic,

types as soon as they are recursive. (Claudio Vaucheret)

## [1.0.438] - 2004-04-26

../plai/domains.pl

Added multi_part_conc/4 (Claudio Vaucheret)

Fixed a nasty bug when analysis has to iterate via
`compute_each_change` related to different names of predicates
when local_control is not off.  (German Puebla)

../spec/unfold_operations.pl

Some auxiliary predicates for unfolding now live here.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.431] - 2004-04-19

../spec/unfold.pl

Added the `hom_emb_l` unfolding rule. It provides a much more
efficient and aggresive behaviour than `hom_emb` by using a
pushdown automata for removing unneeded atoms from the set.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.430] - 2004-04-19

../spec/unfold.pl

Major rewrital of unfolding rules by replacing internal representation
of specialized definitions.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.429] - 2004-04-19

../spec/spec.pl

All unifications introduced by unfolding are now marked as
`no_info` using `put_no_keys/2`.  (German Puebla)

the default value.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.426] - 2004-04-13

../spec/unfold.pl

Added the `hom_emb` unfolding rule which guarantees local
termination by not unfolding atoms which are embedded in atoms already
unfolded in the current derivation.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.425] - 2004-04-13

../spec/unfold.pl

Modified the `first_sol` unfolding rule to stop as soon as a
residual derivation is found instead of all branches solution or
residual.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.424] - 2004-04-08

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

termination.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.420] - 2004-04-05

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

.reg files are now stored in the directory set by tmp_dir pp flag. If
tmp_dir is set to 'source', then .reg files are stored in the same
directory where the corresponding source file resides.  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

improvements yet).  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.416] - 2004-04-05

../plai/intermod.pl

Implementation of the intermodular analysis of a complete program,
including libraries. p_abs:module_is_processable/1 used to generalize

now done using '$meta_call'/1.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.413] - 2004-04-04

../spec/global_control.pl

The data predicate `spec_wrt/10` is now replaced by data
`spec_wrt/3` since all other arguments are not really required
since they can be recovered from `spec_def_for/8`.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.412] - 2004-04-04

../spec/unfold.pl

Implemented the new local_control strategy `det_la` which stands
for 'deterministic with look ahead'. This flag uses the `depth`
argument such that the behaviour of the original deterministic rule is
obtained with depth=1. By making depth=2 we can fully unfold qsort
when called with a known input list.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.411] - 2004-04-04

../spec/unfold.pl

Calls to predicates which can be evaluated are now much more
efficiently performed using the engine predicate
`'$meta_call'/1`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.410] - 2004-04-04

../spec/codegen.pl

Added handling of code generation for `bagof`, `setof` and
`findall`. Handling of existential variables has to be tested.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.409] - 2004-04-04

../plai/fixpo_dx_common.pl

Commented out the special handling of builtin `true/0` in
`entry_to_exit` since it only applied when this was the last
builtin the clause and also makes the corresponding memo_table not
being recorded, which gives problems in partial evaluation.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.408] - 2004-04-04

../p_unit/clidlist.pl

Added handling of `bagof`, `setof` and `findall` to
`inverse_rewrite_source_program/2`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.407] - 2004-04-04

the number of predicates such that all/some of their variants are
non-failing/covered (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.396] - 2004-03-30

../plai/domains.pl

Added a new (domain dependent) operation dom_statistics/2 in order to
generate information about abstract interpreter results, as for
example, statistics about non-failing, covered or deterministic
predicates or variants. If the operation is not defined by an abstract
domain, then the operation succeeds but no information is the
generated (i.e. the empty list is generated) (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.395] - 2004-03-30

../plai/plai.pl

Modified plai/5 in order to generate information about abstract
interpreter results, as for example, statistics about non-failing,
covered or deterministic predicates or variants (besides analysis
times) (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.394] - 2004-03-26

../spec/codegen.pl

Simplified code not to rename exported predicates since that was
complicating things way too much.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.393] - 2004-03-26

`prepare_ai_info` no longer computes the list of experted
versions.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.392] - 2004-03-26

../plai/domains/typeslib/dumper.pl

does not need the domain name.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.391] - 2004-03-26

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Calls to dumper:dump_auxiliary_info/2 changed to
dump_auxiliary_info/1. Now this predicate does not need the domain
name.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.390] - 2004-03-26

../p_unit/p_dump.pl

Calls to dumper:dump_auxiliary_info/2 changed to
dump_auxiliary_info/1. Now this predicate does not need the domain
name.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Calls to dumper:dump_auxiliary_info/2 changed to

../spec/unfold.pl

Negation as failure of calls to builtins can now be fully evaluated at
specialization time.  (German Puebla)

Partial evaluation now handles source programs which contain negation
as failure.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.386] - 2004-03-25

../spec/codegen.pl

Much more efficient implementation of `replace_calls/2`. Clause
bodies are no longer transformed into list format.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.385] - 2004-03-25

../p_unit/clidlist.pl

Extended `inverse_rewrite_source_program/2` to handle
meta-predicates correctly.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.384] - 2004-03-24

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Modified asub_to_info/6 and asub_to_props/4 for adding (two) term size
analysis (separated from time cost analysis): ubsize (upper bounds)
and lbsize (lower bounds).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.383] - 2004-03-24

../driver.pl

Modified analyze_/4 for adding (two) term size analysis (separated
from time cost analysis): ubsize (upper bounds) and lbsize (lower

../infercost/infercost.pl

Implemented (and exported) term_size_analysis/2, for adding (two) term

bounds) and lbsize (lower bounds).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.381] - 2004-03-23

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Added type information handling in .reg files. A reg file will contain
the type information for current module exported predicates, imported
modules predicate calls, and calls from other modules to exported
predicates of the current module.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

is the most aggresive rule. However, it can only be used if the search
space is finite.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.377] - 2004-03-23

../spec/unfold.pl

Improved handling of builtins. Now they can be evaluated even if they
are non-deterministic, as long as they universally terminate since
they are avaluated via findall.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.376] - 2004-03-16

../plai/intermod.pl

The selection of the entry policy applicable to the top-level module
of the current program unit is now moved completely to entry_policy.pl

Added save_config and restore_config (David Trallero Mena)

## [1.0.371] - 2004-03-15

../spec/unfold_builtins.pl

../plai/intermod.pl

Now auto_analyze/2 performs intermodular analysis in an incremental
way: before starting modular analysis, looks for existing .reg files

## [1.0.194] - 2003-12-31

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag `part_conc` which determines whether partial
concretization should be applied or not before unfolding. Note that
this is a new possibility simply not available in traditional partial
evaluation.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.193] - 2003-12-30

../spec/unfold.pl

Implemented homeomorphic embedding and used for improved (always
terminating) global control.  (Elvira Albert)

`cleanup_fixpoint` now executes `cleanup_unfolds` as well
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.177] - 2003-12-29

../plai/fixpo_di.pl

This fixpoint algorithm now uses unfolding prior to analyzing the
clauses which correspond to an atom. This allows both performing
partial evaluation and improving analysis results by propagating
concrete substitutions.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.176] - 2003-12-29

../p_unit/clidlist.pl

Added exported predicate `rewrite_source_all_clauses/2` which is

trusted as to have Prime=Proj (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.155] - 2003-12-18

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added 'botfirst', 'botall', 'botbest' and 'bot' values to
success_policy flag.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.154] - 2003-12-18

../preprocess_flags.pl

'trust' flag name changed to 'success_policy' (it is not used to
handle trust assertions, only for success info of imported
predicates).  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.153] - 2003-12-18

../plai/trust.pl

Imported predicates handling (success policy) moved to plai/success.pl
and removed from this module.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.152] - 2003-12-18

information is now included in .reg files.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.148] - 2003-12-18

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

Low-level registry file handling predicates have been added:
read_registry_file/3, reread_registry_file/3, write_registry_file/3,
and the data predicate registry/2. Although currently they only handle
registry/7 terms in registry files, they have been prepared to easily
extend it to manage other registry information (type descriptions,
specialization and partial evaluation info, etc).  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

## [1.0.147] - 2003-12-18

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

cleanup_p_abs/0 has been modified to keep the registry information of
previously loaded modules, instead of cleaning up all the information

Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.146] - 2003-12-18

../p_unit/p_abs.pl

generate_abs_files/1-3 replaced by gen_registry_info/3 and

analyzed.  (Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [1.0.145] - 2003-12-11

../plai/domains/typeslib/regtype_basic_lattice.pl

Renamed included_in_ground_type/2 to type_included_in_ground/2 (Pedro

Simplification of types perform some tabling (more efficient) (Pedro
Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.143] - 2003-12-11

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Added a type simplification which collapse inferred types to those
defined in the preprocessing unit only. Controlled by the pp_flag
type_output (which is independent of the pp_flag type_precision).
Activate with set_pp_flag(type_output,user). Default is
set_pp_flag(type_output,all) (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.142] - 2003-12-11

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Modified get_NO_par_type_definition/2: Now, a type symbol with no
defining type rule is considered empty (bottom).  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.141] - 2003-12-11

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Modified retract_rule(TypeSymbol): If there is no type rule for
TypeSymbol, then succeeds as before, but do not raise any error
message.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.140] - 2003-12-09

../infer/prepare_ai_output.pl

(lookup PBC).  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.138] - 2003-12-03

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Grouped code for the different operations. Parameter type basics seem
working (some changes here).  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

../plai/domains/typeslib/typeslib.pl

Added preliminary support towards handling parameter types.
(Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

when there are several substitutions applicable.  (Jesus Correas
Fernandez)

## [1.0.134] - 2003-10-15

../p_unit/unexpand.pl

Changed call to 'hiord_rt:call'.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.133] - 2003-10-15

Carrillo)

## [1.0.132] - 2003-10-15

../p_unit/native.pl

Adapted to Ciao 1.11 (module qualifications for native and regtype
builtin properties).  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.131] - 2003-10-14

No engine(builtin_modules) in 1.11!!!  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.130] - 2003-10-13

../ctchecks/assrt_ctchecks_pp.pl

Corrected handling of properties in assertions, since first level
conjunction is represented as a list, even if it contains just one
element. Other corrections as well.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.129] - 2003-10-13

../ctchecks/assrt_ctchecks_common.pl

Added exported predicate `synt_compose_list/3` since now
assertions represent first level conjunctions as lists.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.128] - 2003-10-13

controlled using the `quiet` prolog flag.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.126] - 2003-10-13

../plai/plai.pl

In addition to the abstract domain, messages now also inform about the
fixpoint algorithm used.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.125] - 2003-10-13

../test/Spec/test_spec.pl

Compares the results of program specialization. Though this is
something rather tricky, it is now feasible because: (a) the internal
representation of the specialized program is compared (b) dump files
are stored so that it is possible to reuse fixp ids which in turn
allows that the specialized versions have exactly the same name in
different runs of the analyzer/specializer.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.122] - 2003-10-09

../plai/fixpo_check_di4.pl

This version tries to optimize checking by using the program point
info as forward pointers. This avoids non-determinism when selecting

Created and exported shfr_obtain/3.  (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.120] - 2003-10-09

../plai/domains/nfplai.pl

Fixed bug in compute_modetypes/4: wrong call for obtaining freeness
information which caused that none variable was free. This caused that
the covering check (nf_compute_covering/3) was wrongly called. (Pedro
Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.119] - 2003-10-07

../p_unit/p_dump.pl

Now the `dump_level` flag controls what the contents of the dump
file should be.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.118] - 2003-10-07

called from outside this module.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.116] - 2003-10-07

../plai/fixpo_check_di3.pl

This checker differs from check_di in that neither program point nor
dependency (parents) information is stored.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.115] - 2003-10-07

../plai/fixpo_check_di2.pl

This checker differs from check_di in that program point information
is not stored.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.114] - 2003-10-07

../plai/fixpo_dx_common.pl

Most of code originally in this file is now in
fixpo_dx_check_common.pl (German Puebla)

predicate-level or program-point level information only.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.111] - 2003-10-06

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added exported predicate `store_previous_analysis_completes/1`
which does not store program point info.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.110] - 2003-10-06

../plai/plai.pl

Replaced usage of library(messages) with library(io_aux) and optimized
preprocessing for check_di.  (German Puebla)

../driver.pl

In analyze(Analysis,Info), added nfg analysis time to Info:

## [1.0.105] - 2003-10-03

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added exported predicate `fixpoint_id_reuse_prev_success/6` which
in addition to reusing the identifier for the complete also uses the
answer as initial guess.  (German Puebla)

../plai/fixpo_check_di.pl

Initial version of checking whether an answer table is a fixpoint of

../plai/domains/lsign.pl

Added constraints as builtins: .=., etc.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.64] - 2003-09-09

../printer.pl

Added non_collapsable/1.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.63] - 2003-09-09

../plai/domains/depthk.pl

Added compute_lub, glb, and less_or_equal.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.62] - 2003-09-09

../infer/prepare_ai_output.pl

When no lub, do not add empty (comp) info to the output (accumulate in
prepare_list).  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.61] - 2003-09-08

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Now itf(visible) seems to be working.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.60] - 2003-09-05

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Moved abstract executability for nf/det/cost here.  (Francisco Bueno
Carrillo)

## [1.0.59] - 2003-09-05

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Adapted complexity_property for proper output of cost info.  (Pedro
Lopez Garcia)

## [1.0.58] - 2003-09-04

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Moved abs_execute_with_info/4 here from ctchecks.  (Francisco Bueno
Carrillo)

## [1.0.57] - 2003-09-04

../infercost/algebraic/algebraic.pl

Added file compare.pl from ciaopp 0.8 (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.56] - 2003-09-04

../infer/infer_dom.pl

Moved nf_flags handling here.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.55] - 2003-09-04

../plai/plai.pl

Now the pp_flag reuse_fixp_id controls whether the identifier for the
call (not seen before) should be simply the next available one or
instead we should try to give the same identifier if an equivalent
call was generated in a previous analysis for which
`store_previous_analysis/1` was executed.  This works with any of
the existing fixpoint algorithms available. (German Puebla)

## [1.0.54] - 2003-09-04

../spec/spec.pl

Added predicate `order_completes_by_ids`. It solves (in
conjunction with other changes in the fixpoint algorithms and in
fixpo_ops) the difficult problem of comparing the results of
specialization or all version generation when using different fixpoint
algorithms. The reason for this need is that even if different
analyses generate the same completes with the same identifiers (by
using `fixpoint_id_reuse_prev`, the order in which they are
asserted may be different. As a result, in the specialized program (or
the program with all versions) the version names are in general
different, which makes automatic comparison almost impossible.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.53] - 2003-09-04

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added predicate `remove_useless_info/1` which is useful for
several purposes. One is in order not to create spurious versions
during specialization. Another one is in order to be able to compare
analysis results generated by different fixpoint algorithms. This
implementation is considerably simpler than that in ciaopp-0.8. It is
also independent of the format in which the program is stored.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.52] - 2003-09-02

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added flag error_log.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.51] - 2003-09-02

Changed do_compute_lub for $bottom.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.50] - 2003-09-01

../p_unit/p_unit.pl

Do not write comp or succ assertion for a pred assertion if there is
no info.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.49] - 2003-09-01

../preprocess_flags.pl

Added a flag for controlling whether fixpoint identifiers from a
previous analysis should be reused.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.48] - 2003-09-01

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Added stuff for comparing results of two analysis phases by means of
the predicates `store_previous_analysis/1`,
`fixpoint_id_reuse_prev/5`, and
`compare_with_previous_analysis/1`.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.47] - 2003-09-01

../spec/spec.pl

Printing all versions generated by analysis (vers) now works fine.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.46] - 2003-08-29

../spec/abs_exec.pl

Activated abstract execution for domain def.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.45] - 2003-08-29

../plai/tarjan.pl

The list of predicates defined in a module are no longer taken care of
in module tarjan but rather in `predicate_names/1`, in module
p_unit.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.44] - 2003-08-28

../plai/re_analysis.pl

All code in module re_analysis which is not currently used has been
temporarily removed.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.43] - 2003-08-28

../plai/re_analysis.pl

`update_ai_info_case` working. This allows recovering analysis
information after specialization without an analysis phase.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.42] - 2003-08-28

../infer/prepare_ai_output.pl

Call simplify_step2 for all kind of analyses and assertion of list of
lists for comp properties (Pedro Lopez Garcia)

Added predicate_names/1.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.38] - 2003-08-28

../spec/spec.pl

The way in which facts (clauses with true as body) are represented has
changed. Modified spec.pl to adapt to this change. (German Puebla)

## [1.0.37] - 2003-08-27

../tr_syntax/remdisj.pl

Added calls to sort_dict/2.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo)

## [1.0.36] - 2003-08-27

## [1.0.34] - 2003-08-26

../plai/domains.pl

`aidomain/1` now distinguishes between modes and term domains.
(German Puebla)

## [1.0.33] - 2003-08-25

../plai/tarjan.pl

added predicate `fake_recursive_classify` which clasifies
everything as recursive. Useful when no distinction is needed, as when
the di fixpoint is used.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.32] - 2003-08-25

../plai/plai.pl

The predicate analyze/2 can be used to obtain some info on the
analysis. I have modified plai so that it returns an extra argument
with the preprocessing and analysis times for the module.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.31] - 2003-08-25

../plai/plai.pl

Since the di fixpoint algorithm does not require to know whether
predicates are recursive or not, preprocessing of the program now
avoids computing tarjan (SCCs) when di is used.  (German Puebla)

## [1.0.30] - 2003-08-25

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

The predicate make_atom/2 now lives in plai/fixpo_ops.pl instead of in
pool.pl. All modules using such predicate have been modified.  (German
Puebla)

## [1.0.29] - 2003-08-25

../plai/fixpo_ops.pl

Predicates which are common to all the different fixpoint algorithms
have been moved here to avoid duplications and maintaining multiple
versions of the same code. (German Puebla)

(German Puebla)

## [1.0.26] - 2003-08-21

../p_unit/p_asr.pl

Bug Fixed which prevented loading modules residing in a directory
different from the current directory. This bug also raised in some
cases when a module used another module in a different directory.
(Jesus Correas Fernandez)

## [0.8.38] - 2003-08-28

Corrected bug in update_ai_goal (German Puebla).

## [0.8.37] - 2003-06-04

Since delay declarations in Ciao currently do not include

`freeze/2` whenever possible has been commented out.  (German
Puebla).

## [0.8.36] - 2003-05-24

Added code to avoid non-termination of specialization of recursive

Claudio Vaucheret.  (German Puebla).

## [0.8.32] - 2003-04-25

Added missing `use_module('ciaopp_zero.spec'(spec_delay))` since

here.  (German Puebla).

## [0.8.16] - 2001-10-26

Changed preshell/0 to avoid the uncontrolled execution aborts
(Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.8.15] - 2001-09-10

Run-time checking can now be performed at program-point
level. Implemented by Elisa Fromont.  (German Puebla).

Added list/1 as builtin in sharefree.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.8.12] - 2001-07-26

When a literal has bottom as success substitution, a `fail` rather
than a `bottom` is added to the end of the clause. This is useful
for debugging as specialization. Not completely sure this is correct!!
(A. German Puebla Sanchez).

## [0.8.11] - 2001-07-25

Program point assertions are now treated as builtins for mode
analysis. This allows analyzing programs which contain program-point
assertions.  (A. German Puebla Sanchez).

## [0.8.10] - 2001-05-31

Added op declaration for &.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.8.9] - 2001-03-22

Fixed a bug in handling of `findall/3`.  (A. German Puebla
Sanchez).

## [0.8.8] - 2001-03-22

scheme. The rtchecks library has also been correspondingly updated.
(A. German Puebla Sanchez).

(dr_support.pl) to patch it.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.7.24] - 1999-11-30

Entries in database had 'ptN'-like types instead of parametric. Solved
by using par_equiv_types/2 (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.7.23] - 1999-11-30

With bottom and collapse_ai_vers(no) we got true() instead of
true(fails). Added prepare_point_info/5 to solve this. (Francisco
Bueno Carrillo).

The predicate `indep/1` is added to the set of builtins
understood by analysis if annotation is performed and reanalysis is

which should be less dependent on the machine load than
`walltime/1`.  (A. German Puebla Sanchez).

## [0.6.15] - 1999-04-12

Adapted to work with the different fixpoint algorithms now in the
system.  (A. German Puebla Sanchez).

## [0.6.14] - 1999-04-09

As now there are several fixpoint algorithms, the module `fixpoint`
which contains the traditional fixpoint algorithm in PLAI has been
renamed to `plai_fixp`.  (A. German Puebla Sanchez).

## [0.6.13] - 1999-04-09

Integrated the _top-dowm_ or _depth-dependent_ fixpoint
algorithm for (incremental) analysis.  (A. German Puebla Sanchez).

undoall_fdtypes/0. Also, replaced abolish by retractall (Francisco
Bueno Carrillo).

to assert them from the imported modules. (Francisco Bueno
Carrillo).

rep_clauses/3 now just translates clauses from the format used in
precompiler to the format used within the analyzer. (Francisco
Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.4.9] - 1998-2-27

Magic transformation rewritten so that it asserts the clauses instead
of printing them to a file.  (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.4.8] - 1998-2-27

Created main file inferfdtypes.pl. It incorporates utility predicates
in t.pl and typer.pl. (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.4.7] - 1998-2-27

All definitions of builtin types duplicated so that they are defined
by predicate inline_clause/2 and a findall can be done of this
predicate to return the definitions WITHOUT module name expansion.
(Francisco Bueno Carrillo).

## [0.4.6] - 1998-2-27

Changed one findall from clause/2 to inline_clause/2, since otherwise
it does not work in ciao because of the module name
expansion. (Francisco Bueno Carrillo).
